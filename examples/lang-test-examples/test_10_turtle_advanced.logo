; Arc (if available, otherwise approximating)
; PyLogo has standard turtle which has circle(radius, extent)

; UCBLogo has ARC radius degrees
; Python turtle has circle(radius, extent)
; Let's assume standard logo set might map to python

; My turtle_builtins.py implementation of circle only took radius.
; Let's stick to what I know works or likely works.
