# CLASP

A Python-based programming tool.

## Setup

To set up the project environment, run the setup script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This will create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies (PyQt6).

## Running the Application

To launch the application, use the run script:

```bash
./run.sh
```

If the virtual environment is not set up, the run script will attempt to run the setup script first.
